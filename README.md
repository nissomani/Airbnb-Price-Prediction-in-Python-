# Airbnb-Price-Prediction-in-Python-
Practical case study by developing a predictive model which accurately forecasted Airbnb prices.
Performing Explanatory Data Analysis uncovered patterns, identifying relationships, and drawing meaningful conclusions. Test data was trained on the existing training
dataset predicting the prices of the existing listings forecasting accurate prices for the listings, ensuring competitive prices and a rise in bookings in the upcoming FY by 7%
The training data set contained 61 variables including text data and null values, which were imputed by data imputation techniques after extensively looking into their various
features by conducting data wrangling and cleaning to ensure their accuracy.
Various regression models including Lasso, RANSAC, Ridge, Elastic Net, SVMs & Random Forest Regressor were used, where the last one gave the lowest and best possible
result.
